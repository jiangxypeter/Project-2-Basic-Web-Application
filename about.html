			<h2>About Us</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="col-md-8 about-info">
				<h3>Our Needs</h3>
				<p>The website aesthetics should draw inspiration from, and reflect the personality of, Canberra as a 
					TopBuildingsist city, primarily developed in the mid-twentieth century and the architecture and planning 
					that makes its distinctive as Australia’s designed National Capital.</p>
				<h3>The website needs to be image and design driven.</h3>
				<p>The mid-twentieth century, the post-WWII period, 
					was a time of bold and innovative design, across all fields such as architecture, fashion, graphic and 
					industrial design. Experimentation with new shapes, colours, compositions, materials etc saw the 
					designers of this time pushing the boundaries of classic design tradition and setting a new aesthetic. </p>
				<h3>For example:</h3>
				<p>Whilst it has a serious message of heritage conservation, Canberra TopBuildings’s events are enjoyable 
					and fun – trying to provide an academically sound conservation message in an accessible and 
					digestible manner. For example: Martini’s at Manning Clark House (an event where participants 
					learnt about the history of martinis, while enjoying martinis and toured the historically significant -
					Manning Clark House, hearing about it historic, conservation challenges and future proposals).
					Like this event, the website needs to reflect this and be somewhat playful.</p>
				<p>The Canberra TopBuildings website needs to provide an ‘always on’ element to our work. While events 
					are periodic, CM are always working on their conservation message.</p>	
				<p>
					Our motto, and brand, is ‘Conservation Through Participation’, so giving website visitors a sense of 
how to get involved is important. Clear links to mailing lists, social media and other related 
information are critical.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a need to showcase upcoming events on the front page and have a clear event calendar.
Also, we need to be able to showcase other website content eg videos, self-guided tours as required 
on the homepage.
				</p>
				<p>We communicate with our Partners via Instagram and Facebook; therefore, advertising this on the 
					front page would be good. Also, a ‘news’ section where we might post issues of interest. For 
					example, opportunities to comment on heritage listings, events, publications and articles.</p>
				<p>
					Canberra TopBuildings is a small group of volunteers, with very basic digital platform management skills. 
					Therefore, the website needs to be easy and intuitive for multiple users to maintain and update. 
					That is: there is no single person allocated as Canberra TopBuildings’s website management, there are 
					about five (5) users who need to access an update material on the website.
