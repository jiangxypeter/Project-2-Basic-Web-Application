				<h3>Our Needs</h3>
				<p>The website aesthetics should draw inspiration from, and reflect the personality of, Canberra as a 
					modernist city, primarily developed in the mid-twentieth century and the architecture and planning 
					that makes its distinctive as Australia’s designed National Capital.</p>
				<h3>The website needs to be image and design driven.</h3>
				<p>The mid-twentieth century, the post-WWII period, 
					was a time of bold and innovative design, across all fields such as architecture, fashion, graphic and 
					industrial design. Experimentation with new shapes, colours, compositions, materials etc saw the 
					designers of this time pushing the boundaries of classic design tradition and setting a new aesthetic. </p>
				<h3>For example:</h3>
				<p>Whilst it has a serious message of heritage conservation, Canberra Modern’s events are enjoyable 
					and fun – trying to provide an academically sound conservation message in an accessible and 
					digestible manner. For example: Martini’s at Manning Clark House (an event where participants 
					learnt about the history of martinis, while enjoying martinis and toured the historically significant -
					Manning Clark House, hearing about it historic, conservation challenges and future proposals).
					Like this event, the website needs to reflect this and be somewhat playful.</p>
				<p>The Canberra Modern website needs to provide an ‘always on’ element to our work. While events 
					are periodic, CM are always working on their conservation message.</p>	
				<p>
					Our motto, and brand, is ‘Conservation Through Participation’, so giving website visitors a sense of 
how to get involved is important. Clear links to mailing lists, social media and other related 
information are critical.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a need to showcase upcoming events on the front page and have a clear event calendar.
Also, we need to be able to showcase other website content eg videos, self-guided tours as required 
on the homepage.
				</p>
				<p>We communicate with our audience via Instagram and Facebook; therefore, advertising this on the 
					front page would be good. Also, a ‘news’ section where we might post issues of interest. For 
					example, opportunities to comment on heritage listings, events, publications and articles.</p>
				<p>
					Canberra Modern is a small group of volunteers, with very basic digital platform management skills. 
					Therefore, the website needs to be easy and intuitive for multiple users to maintain and update. 
					That is: there is no single person allocated as Canberra Modern’s website management, there are 
					about five (5) users who need to access an update material on the website.

				<h6><a href="#">What's so special about Canberra?</a></h6>
				<span>2022</span>
				<p>Canberra is a young city with a rich architectural legacy. With major boom periods in the 1920s and again from the 1950s-1980s – the architectural aesthetic of the city is eclectic, but deliberately cohesive.The mid-late twentieth century period of development in Canberra, specifically during the National Capital Development Commission’s (NCDC) oversight (1958-1989) has not been widely celebrated or recognised by the Canberra community.Major developments not only in residential, but civic and community buildings saw the frequent involvement of architects now considered pioneers of the modernist movement, and the construction of a key collection of iconic and unique mid-century buildings in Australia.  </p>
