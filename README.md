# Project 2: Basic Web Application
## U3224992-Project 2: Basic Web Application-Rationale

### Before making a web page, I first collect the resources needed to build a web page. Organize these resources (text, images, API, links...) and categorize them.

I chose to use the Bootstrap framework to build the web page. Write the Html first, then the CSS. Make sure the API is applied in the request. Make a flow layout, 
and then write the corresponding style. Then write components in modules. Finally, fill in the text content. and check if the web page is working fine.

About the reasons for choosing bootstrap. That's because bootstrap is by far the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework. Can be used to develop responsive layout, 
mobile-first web projects.Bootstrap is simple and flexible. A collection of html, css, and javascript tools that can be used to architect popular user interfaces and interactive interfaces. 
Based on html5, css3, bootstrap has a lot of attractive features: friendly learning curve, excellent compatibility, responsive design, 12-column grid, style wizard documentation. 
The detailed reasons for choosing Bootstrap are mainly as follows.The first is Bootstrap's advantage over the grid system. It adjusts the page to the user's screen size, making it perform well across all sizes.
The realization of this function depends on two things, one is view, the other is max-width, min-width. The second is excellent CSS modularity. Bootstrap pre-defines a lot of CSS classes, 
and you can directly assign the corresponding class name to the class when you use it. For example text-left, text-align, .table, etc. The most representative is the btn class.
 Bootstrap defines a .bt base class. If you want other styles, you can extend this base class to achieve different visual effects. Third, Bootstrap's plugins are very simple to use.
Bootstrap's plug-in development mode is very similar to the javaScript development mode. First, a class is defined to implement the main function, then a Plugin function, 
and then this function is extended to the JQuery prototype. Finally, events are bound to specific elements through delegation. This is very friendly to using plugins. But Bootstrap also has some problems. 
For example browser compatibility issues (Bootstrap is not compatible with IE6).

I think the benefits of using Bootstrap for developers are the following. 
First, Bootstrap can improve development efficiency. Second, the Bootstrap canonical name is defined for easy maintenance. 
Third, standardize the project development process. This reduces risk while making the project easier to manage.
Fourth, user downloads can be reduced in large-scale projects. Fifth, Bootstrap grid system and responsive layout. 
It makes it easy for developers to make web pages get the best experience on desktops, tablet devices, and mobile phones. 
That's why I chose to use Bootstrap for this project.
